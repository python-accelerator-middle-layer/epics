"""Demonstrator of a measurement execution engine

Todo:
    * implement full functionality

Missing features:

* handling behaviour_on_error
* how much of the accelerator access to wrap?
* hide devices behind a software multiplexer?
  In its current form quite some information will be stored
  in the databroker
